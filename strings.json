  "Original_Author:_#Ra": "Original Author: #RaphaelOctober 31, 2022",
  "‍": "‍",
  "Zettahash_proposes_a": "Zettahash proposes an open source, public controlled, Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) for the Bitcoin mining industry, leveraging the capabilities of Web3 infrastructure. This initiative marks a significant shift from traditional corporate structures by adopting a decentralized governance token. A digital token that is free from centralized control, boundaries and barriers. A share that is open for all to participate and contribute, globally. An entity characterized by transparency and integrity, demonstrating fiscal responsibility. A DAO that does not direct its revenue to a centralized and privileged few, preventing the dictation of high salaries, unwarranted bonuses, or other preferential treatment and compensation for executives, managing directors, or other majority-controlled shareholders.",
  "Instead,_it_collecti": "Instead, it collectively rewards its decentralized token holders by enhancing the token's value by providing verifiable proof of revenue generated from Bitcoin mining and various other ventures. This comprehensive document delves into the intricate aspects of the token's structural framework, deflationary mechanisms, allocation strategies, the complexities of decentralized Bitcoin mining operations, the framework of public company governance and participation, and an unwavering dedication to fostering balanced, authentic, and transparent decentralized mining practices.",

While these entities have played a crucial role in enhancing the network's adoption, strength, growth, and visibility, an unintended outcome has been a reduced opportunity for the average individual to engage in the mining process, resulting in a consolidation of power and influence. The traditional barriers to entry, often linked with financial investment methods such as stocks publicly traded on Wall Street or private funding organized by private institutions, have further exacerbated this divide. As a response to these challenges, Zettahash emerged as an innovative solution, poised to bridge the gap between centralized and decentralized Bitcoin mining organizations through the combined strength of a larger global peer group and its engagement with the digital token market.",
  "Zettahash's_fundamen": "Zettahash's fundamental goal is to restore balance and inclusivity in the Bitcoin mining industry, amplifying the trustless democratized essence of Bitcoin.

  "Zettahash_is_committ": "Zettahash is committed to being a transparent and honest entity that does not award itself, executives, or managing members with generated profits, unjustifiable salaries, bonuses, and other perks. Instead, Zettahash rewards its token holders by increasing the value of the token with its generated revenue through Bitcoin mining and other ventures. We see Zettahash as a new frontier for publicly traded companies worldwide, increasing transparency, equity, and accountability.",
  "In_the_spirit_of_dem": "In the spirit of democratic principles, the Zettahash Community Consensus Forum emerges as a platform where every participant’s voice resonates. Based on a democratic process, the forum employs an upvoting mechanism that grants community members the power to elevate topics of significance. This section illuminates how this democratic framework, coupled with the vigilant attention of the Zettahash team, enables community-driven decision-making.",

  "The_concept_of_a_mul": "The concept of a multisig wallet with elected members in a DAO bears similarities to the governance structure of a democratic elected congress:",
  "Contributions_will_b": "Contributions will be allocated exclusively to Capital Expenses (CapEx) and Operating Expenses (OpEx) related to the foundation’s Bitcoin mining operations. CapEx will cover expenses for example: Bitcoin digital mining machine purchases, infrastructure, equipment acquisitions, etc. OpEx includes hosting agreements, operation’s team salaries, electricity costs, and other operational necessities. Net Bitcoin mining profits are reinvested either by acquiring Zettahash shares directly from the global marketplace at prevailing market prices (market share buyback) or by allocating these funds to support the ongoing expansion of mining operations and other ventures. The DAO decides which best course of action should be taken.",
  "Zettahash_is_fully_c": "Zettahash is fully committed to upholding an exceptional degree of transparency in disclosing its extensive array of assets. This includes a full disclosure of all organization owned assets; fully auditable financials available to the public.",
  "As_an_integral_compo": "As an integral component of our commitment to transparency, we will publicly reveal the wallet addresses linked to Bitcoin mining and holdings and other prominent crypto assets such as for example but not limited to, “stablecoins.” Additionally, this transparency will extend to bank statements, offering a limited but illuminating view of our fiat holdings, along with insights into our diverse portfolio involving different currencies and property holdings.",

Initially, this will be facilitated through participation in a public or private mining pool, granting interested participants access to authentic and timely financial performance.",
  "-Satoshi_Nakamoto,_t": "-Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, outlined his motivations and intentions in the original Bitcoin whitepaper titled \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,“- published October 31, 2008. While we cannot definitively know Satoshi's true intentions, the whitepaper provides insights into the goals and purposes behind the creation of Bitcoin.",
  "1._Decentralization_": "1. Decentralization and Peer-to-Peer Transactions: Satoshi aimed to create a decentralized digital currency system that would allow individuals to conduct peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries like banks or financial institutions. This would enable direct transfer of value between parties, reducing the need for trust in third parties.",
  "2._Eliminating_Doubl": "2. Eliminating Double Spending: One of the key challenges in digital currency systems was the potential for double spending—spending the same digital token more than once. Satoshi proposed a solution using a decentralized consensus mechanism, known as proof-of-work, to prevent double spending and ensure the integrity of transactions.",
  "3._Openness_and_Tran": "3. Openness and Transparency: Bitcoin's design emphasized transparency through a public ledger called the blockchain. Every transaction is recorded on the blockchain, providing an open and verifiable history of all transactions.",
  "4._Limited_Supply:_B": "4. Limited Supply: Bitcoin was designed with a capped supply of 21 million coins to prevent inflation and maintain scarcity, similar to precious metals like gold. This scarcity was intended to ensure that the value of Bitcoin would not be easily diluted over time.",

  "In_2008,_Satoshi_Nak": "In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto introduced the world to a new kind of money. This money could be exchanged without the need for financial intermediaries or a centralized ledger. To make this new kind of money possible, Satoshi implemented a mechanism called Proof-of-Work. Proof-of-Work enables computers to use energy to secure the network. In the early days, bitcoin mining was done on personal computers. Today, specialized computers known as ASICs are kept in industrial-scale data centers, using hundreds of megawatts of power. Instead of a bunch of hobbyists running mining rigs in their homes' basements, massive publicly traded companies dominate the hashrate and narrative.But for all the revolution that bitcoin brought to p2p money, bitcoin mining is stuck in the old financial system that bitcoin promised to challenge. Today, the biggest miners are publicly traded on traditional finance systems known as stock markets. Worse, the poster child for the worst aspects of the existing financial system, Blackrock, owns a significant percentage of shares in 4 out of 5 of the biggest public companies. Blackrock owns over 8% of Marathon's shares.Public mining companies dilute their shares as a way to raise more capital. CleanSpark, Marathon, and Riot have all entered into agreements that make this possible. Diluting shares reduces shareholders' ownership and share value. This is a fiat mindset. Printing shares is philosophically no different from printing money to raise capital. Public companies might argue that while nation-states print money to fund wars, they're doing so to fund mining expansion to remain competitive. They might even argue that they're doing it because it's the only way...But there's another way.Bitcoin mining is not just trending toward centralization. It has major risks of centralization attacks right now. Many mining pools are acting as sub-pools feeding into the biggest pool operating right now, AntPool, empowering it with the majority share. Before, bitcoiners argued that in the case of a mining pool controlling 51% of the hashrate, miners would leave the pool and move to a different one to course correct and re-decentralize the hashrate. But with pressure from boards of directors and majority shareholders (when will Blackrock take over?) and the pursuit to make them happy, how do we know that the public companies will do the right thing? In the last epoch, Marathon tried to censor non-OFAC-compliant transactions, but thankfully caved to public pressure. What's to say they'll cave this time? Especially when Marathon and other public companies are rooted in the US where regulatory crackdowns are coming fast and hard. Let's not forget that public companies control a significant portion of the hashrate (around 20 percent). There's another way.We've made it through four halvings. The time when they fight you is here. This epoch is about fighting for the soul of bitcoin. Bitcoin isn't about pumping Microstrategy's bags. It's not about funneling normies into traditional finance investment products like Blackrock's ETF. It's about censorship resistance, it's about privacy, it's about fighting back against money printing and centralized financial power. Bitcoin is resistance money until it isn't. We don't have to let Wall St and governments force bitcoin into a safe box where it can be controlled and used as nothing more than a place for the Davos crowd to store their wealth. It doesn't have to be this way. There's another way.The power they took from the people must be returned to the people.There is only one way. We must decentralize mining governance. Zettahash is the world's first bitcoin mining collective. Building on the long history of successful cooperatives and collectives, we will create an operation that is run sustainably, fairly, and transparently. Together, we can take back the hashrate.No CEO bonuses.No share buybacks.No diluted stocks.No deals behind closed doors.Arise, you have nothing to lose but your Wall St masters!",
